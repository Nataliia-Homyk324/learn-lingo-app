This is an application for a company offering to use the services of online language teachers. With the help of firebase_DB, I added the possibility of authorization to the application (registration, login, obtaining data about the current user, logout). The collection of teachers is also created in VRealtime Database (by firebase). It was interesting to learn how to use this resource, which replaced the backend in my project. The project implements pagination (initially, 4 teacher cards are downloaded, then you can download more). If you click on the Read more button, the card opens with more detailed information about the teacher and feedback from his students.

Added filtering: by language of instruction; according to the level of knowledge of students with whom the teacher works; at the price per hour of class. For authorized users, there is an option to add teachers to favorites, which can be viewed on the favorites page. This option is not available to unauthorized users. Forms for registration, login and ordering a trial lesson open in modal windows. The layout from 320x to 1440x is rubber, is drawn on mobile and tablet devices.
